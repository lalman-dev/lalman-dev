# Hi, I’m Lalman 👋

🚀 Frontend Engineer (React / Next.js)  
TypeScript • App Router • SSR/CSR • Tailwind CSS • Framer Motion

I build **production-grade, performance-focused web interfaces** with a strong emphasis on
rendering strategy, predictable state, accessibility, and real-world UX constraints.

Comfortable owning frontend features end-to-end — from architecture decisions to polished UI
and resilient error/loading states.

- Managing **real-world client-side state and data flows**
- Writing **clean, maintainable, and review-friendly code**
- Shipping features that balance **developer experience and user experience**

## 🧩 How I Work

- Think in **components, data flow, and UX states**
- Prefer **boring, reliable solutions** over unnecessary complexity
- Comfortable reading and improving unfamiliar codebases
- Communicate clearly in async, remote-first environments
- Bias toward shipping, then iterating

---

## 🌱 Currently Exploring
- Advanced rendering patterns in Next.js (App Router)
- Frontend performance profiling and optimization
- Better architectural patterns for early-stage startup codebases
